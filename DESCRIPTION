Title: Variable Selection for Joint Modeling of Mean and Dispersion
Version: 0.0.1
Description: A Package for selecting variables for the joint modeling of mean and dispersion (including models for mixture experiments) based on hypothesis testing and the quality of model's fit. In each iteration of the selection process, a criterion for checking the goodness of fit is used as a filter for choosing the terms that will be evaluated by a hypothesis test.
